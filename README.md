# P5 Canvas
A simple p5 canvas component. The canvas component only exports a canvas to be used as a template for your next P5 project.


## Usage
The p5 canvas component generates a baseline component.  All functions needed to handle your p5 drawing can be written in a separate .js file and the function itself can be passed through this component.

There is only one prop needed to draw on the canvas:
- `script`: Pass a p5 function through this prompt, to the component. It will be used to setup and draw on the canvas, as you would expect.
    - Default: If this is not passed a red background with white text will be generated by default.

### Example usage:
```
<template>
    <canvas :script='myScript'>
</template>

<script>
data () {
    return () {
        myScript: null
    }
},
mounted () {
    this.myScript = require('../scripts/p5/myTest.js').default
}
</script>
```
